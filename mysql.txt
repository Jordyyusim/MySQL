create table tablename(
 -> no int,
 -> name varchar(100),
 -> age tinyint,
 -> );
- no, name, and age are fieldnames
- int, varchar, tinyint are the types of data

insert into tablename values
 -> (1,A,20),
 -> (2,B,22);
- the value amounts must be the same with fieldname amounts

insert into tablename values
 -> (3,C,null),
 -> (4,null,26);
- null if you want empty the field

insert into tablename(location,gender,etc) values(...,...,...);
- the values must be in order by its fieldnames

insert into tablename (location) values ('A'), ('B'), ('C');

select * from tablename;
- show all datas in table
)

select specific_fields from tablename;
- show only fieldnames and their datas you wanted to show

create table murid(
 -> id int not null auto_increment,
 -> name varchar(255) default 'ABC',
 -> bod date,
 -> created_at timestamp default current_timestamp,
 -> last_update timestamp default current_timestamp on update current_timestamp,
 -> gender enum('male', 'female'),
 -> city set('London', 'Birmingham', 'Charlton'),
 -> email varhcar(100) not null unique
 -> primary key(id));

- not null = field must be filled
- auto_increment = field filled by number in order
- default = when the field is null, sql fill it with the default automatically
- date = dates(yymmdd -> 2020-04-20)
- current_timetamp = time now (date and time)
- on update current_timestamp = latest time you update the fields
- enum = the field value must be one of them
- set = the field value can one or more
- unique = the field value for each data must be different
- primary key = you cannot edit the field value

select * from tablename where fieldname='';
- show all datas with specific value 

select * from tablename where fieldname='' and fieldname='';
- - show all datas with specific values

select * from tablename limit 2;
- show two first datas

select * from tablename limit 2,3;
- show three first datas starts from third row

select * from tablename where name like '%a';
- show all data where fieldname is name and its value ends with -a

select * from tablename where name like 'a%';
- show all data where fieldname is name and its value starts with a-

select * from tablename where name like '%a%';
- show all data where fieldname is name and value middle char is -a-

select * from tablename where name not like '%a';
- show all data where fieldname is name and its value not ends with -a

select count(*) from tablename;
- how many datas or table rows in the table(fieldname exclude)

select count(*) as total_rows from tablename;
- as = alias = fieldname

select min (fieldname)
- lowest value in the specific fieldname

select max (fieldname)
- highest value in the specific fieldname

select sum(fieldname)
- sum of the value in the specific fieldname

select avg(fieldname)
- avg of the value in the specific fieldname

select count(*), min(), max(), sum(), avg() from tablename;

select * from tablename order by fieldname;
- sort the table depends on specific fieldname. default is ascending. put desc if needed

select * from tablename group by fieldname;
- show all datas with different values according to fieldname

select city, count(*) from tablename group by city;
- it will show city and count as fieldname and how many data for every cities in table

select date(now());
- today's date (yy-mm-dd)

select now();
- today's date + time(hour:minute:second)

select date_format(date_now(), '%d/%m/%y');
- the dates will be dd/mm/yy

select bod, date_format((bod), '%d/%m/%y') from tablename;
- if you want change date format in your table. bod is birth of date

update tablename set fieldname=newvalue where fieldname=value;
- change into new value in fieldname field for every data in specific fieldname and value

update tablename set
-> name='A', age=20 where id=1;

delete tablename where fieldname='';
- delete the specific data depends on value in fieldname

delete tablename / drop tablename;
- delete the whole table

drop database databasename;
- delete the database
